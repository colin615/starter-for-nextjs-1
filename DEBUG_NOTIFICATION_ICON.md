# üîç Debugging Notification Icon

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Component returning `null`
The NotificationCenter had `if (!user) return null` which prevented the bell icon from rendering until the user was loaded.

**Fixed:** Removed the early return, icon now always renders (just disabled until user loads).

### Issue 2: Using AuthContext
The component was using the AuthContext which might not be initialized in the server-rendered layout.

**Fixed:** Component now directly calls `account.get()` in a useEffect to get the user.

### Issue 3: No visual feedback
No way to tell if the component was rendering at all.

**Fixed:** Added console logs and a wrapper div.

## How to Debug

### 1. Check Browser Console

Open your dashboard and check the browser console for these logs:

```
üîî NotificationCenter rendering { user: undefined, unreadCount: 0 }
‚úÖ NotificationCenter: User loaded [user-id]
üîî NotificationCenter rendering { user: [user-id], unreadCount: 0 }
```

### 2. Check React DevTools

1. Open React DevTools in your browser
2. Search for "NotificationCenter" component
3. Check if it's in the component tree
4. Inspect its props and state

### 3. Visual Check

The bell icon should:
- ‚úÖ **Always be visible** in the top-right header
- ‚úÖ Be **slightly grayed out** initially (disabled state)
- ‚úÖ Become **clickable** once user loads
- ‚úÖ Show a **red badge** when there are unread notifications

### 4. Inspect Element

Right-click the header area and "Inspect Element". You should see:

```html
<div class="flex flex-1 items-center justify-between">
  <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <!-- Breadcrumbs -->
  </div>
  <div class="flex items-center">  <!-- ‚Üê NotificationCenter wrapper -->
    <button class="relative hover:bg-accent" disabled>
      <svg><!-- Bell icon --></svg>
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Still Not Visible?

### Check 1: Environment Variables

Make sure these are in your `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=skapex-dash-db
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_NOTIFICATIONS_COLLECTION_ID=notifications
```

### Check 2: Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Check 3: Clear Browser Cache

Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

### Check 4: Check the Layout

View source on the dashboard page and search for "NotificationCenter" or "Bell" to verify it's being rendered in the HTML.

## Console Commands to Test

Open browser console on the dashboard and run:

```javascript
// Check if NotificationCenter is rendered
document.querySelector('[title="Notifications"]')

// Check if Bell icon is present
document.querySelector('svg.lucide-bell')

// Check header structure
document.querySelector('header')
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **On page load:** Bell icon appears (disabled/grayed)
2. **After 1-2 seconds:** Bell icon becomes active (clickable)
3. **Click test button:** Badge appears with "1"
4. **Click bell:** Drawer slides in from right
5. **See notification:** "Test Notification üéâ"

1. Browser console output
2. Screenshot of the React DevTools component tree
3. Screenshot of the header HTML in Inspector
