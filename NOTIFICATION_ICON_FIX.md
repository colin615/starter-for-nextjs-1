# 🔔 Notification Icon - Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The notification bell icon wasn't visible because each dashboard page had its own `SidebarInset` wrapper with a header, which was overriding the layout's header that contained the `NotificationCenter` component.

### Before (Problem):
```
Layout:
  ├─ Header with NotificationCenter 🔔 
  └─ {children}

Dashboard Page:
  └─ SidebarInset
      ├─ Header (overrides layout header!) ❌
      └─ Content
```

The page's header was replacing the layout's header, so the notification bell never appeared.

## What Was Fixed

I removed the `SidebarInset` wrappers from all dashboard pages, so the layout's header (with the notification icon) is now visible across all pages.

### After (Fixed):
```
Layout:
  ├─ Header with NotificationCenter 🔔 ✅
  └─ {children}

Dashboard Page:
  └─ Content (no wrapper, uses layout header)
```

## Files Changed

1. **src/app/dashboard/page.jsx** - Removed SidebarInset wrapper
2. **src/app/dashboard/connected-sites/page.jsx** - Removed SidebarInset wrapper
3. **src/app/dashboard/leaderboards/page.jsx** - Removed SidebarInset wrapper
4. **src/app/dashboard/layout.js** - Already had NotificationCenter in header

## ✅ Result

Now the notification bell icon (🔔) appears in the top-right corner of **all dashboard pages**:
- Dashboard
- Connected Sites
- Leaderboards
- Any future dashboard pages

## 🎉 You Can Now:

1. **See the bell icon** in the top-right of your dashboard
2. **Click it** to open the notifications drawer
3. **Test it** by clicking "Send Test Notification" button
4. **Watch it update in real-time** when new notifications arrive

---

**Ready to test!** Just refresh your dashboard page and you should see the bell icon! 🔔
