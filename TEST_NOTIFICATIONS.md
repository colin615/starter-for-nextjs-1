# Testing the Updated Notification System

## Quick Test Checklist

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
npm run dev
```

1. âœ… Log in to your account
2. âœ… Click the bell icon in the top right
3. âœ… Click "Send Test Notification" button
4. âœ… Verify notification appears in the panel
5. âœ… Check browser console for: "âœ… Loaded X notifications"
6. âœ… Test marking as read
7. âœ… Test deleting notifications
8. âœ… Wait 30 seconds and verify auto-refresh works

### 2. Production Testing
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Or deploy to Vercel and test:

1. âœ… Log in to your account
2. âœ… Send a test notification
3. âœ… Verify it appears (may take up to 30 seconds)
4. âœ… Open notification panel - should refresh immediately
5. âœ… Test all CRUD operations

### 3. Debug Mode

Check browser console for these messages:

- `ðŸ”” NotificationCenter rendering` - Component is loading
- `âœ… Loaded X notifications` - Notifications fetched successfully
- Any errors will be logged with details

### 4. Network Tab

In browser DevTools â†’ Network tab, you should see:

- `GET /api/notifications/list` - Every 30 seconds
- `PATCH /api/notifications/{id}` - When marking as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/{id}` - When deleting
- All requests should have session cookies attached

## Expected Behavior

### Polling
- Notifications automatically refresh every 30 seconds
- When you open the notification panel, it immediately fetches latest

### Operations
- All operations are optimistic (UI updates immediately)
- If server fails, UI reverts to previous state
- All operations work both locally and in production

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
**Check:**
1. User is logged in (session cookie exists)
2. Database and collection IDs are correct in `.env`
3. API routes are accessible (check `/api/notifications/list` directly)

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Check:**
1. Session cookie is being sent (Network tab â†’ Cookies)
2. Middleware is not blocking API routes
3. Appwrite session is still valid

### Issue: Polling not working
**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Component hasn't unmounted (interval cleanup)
3. Network tab shows requests every 30 seconds

### Issue: Notifications appear but can't interact
**Check:**
1. Notification document has correct permissions
2. User ID matches the logged-in user
3. API routes return successful responses

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Environment variables are set in Vercel
- [ ] Database and collection exist in Appwrite
- [ ] Collection has proper indexes (userId)
- [ ] Document permissions are configured
- [ ] API routes are not blocked by middleware
- [ ] Session cookies work across domains (if applicable)

## Performance Notes

### Polling Frequency
Current: **30 seconds**

Adjust in `src/components/NotificationCenter.jsx`:
```javascript
const POLLING_INTERVAL = 30000; // Change this value
```

**Recommendations by traffic:**
- Low traffic: 10-30 seconds
- Medium traffic: 30-60 seconds  
- High traffic: 60-120 seconds

### Database Queries
- Index on `userId` for faster queries
- Limit to 50 most recent notifications
- Consider pagination for users with many notifications

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. âœ… Notifications appear in both localhost and production
2. âœ… Bell icon shows unread count badge
3. âœ… Auto-refresh works (new notifications appear without page reload)
4. âœ… All CRUD operations work smoothly
5. âœ… No WebSocket errors in console
6. âœ… No authentication errors in production
